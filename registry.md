## Introduction

In my application I needed to be able to dynamically load type and their dependency at runtime. 
My few interaction with various IoC framework / library were not the most successful. Except with MEF, which seemed great at the time!
Except every time I wanted to use it again I completely forget how to set it up and had to Google for a few hours.
Hence this library which is (hopefully) as easy to use as MEF but with almost no setup required.

Enter `Galador.Reflection.Registry`
